# Facial-Keypoint-and-Emotion-Recognition
Facial expressions are the facial changes in response to a person’s internal emotional states, intentions, or social communications. Facial expression analysis has
been an active research topic for behavioral scientists since the work of Darwin in 1872. It is one of the most powerful, natural and immediate means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intensions. Automatic facial expression analysis is an interesting and challenging problem, and impacts important applications in many areas
such as human–computer interaction and data-driven animation.
Here, we have detected the facial keypoints and also recognized the facial expressions.
